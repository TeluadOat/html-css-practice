            <h2>The origin of lions</h2>
            <p> Lions originated in Africa around 2 million years ago and evolved from a common ancestor of the
                Panthera
                genus. They later migrated into Europe, the Middle East, and Asia during the Pleistocene epoch. Fossil
                evidence shows that lions once roamed widely across these regions. Today, most wild lions live in
                sub-Saharan Africa, while a small population of Asiatic lions survives in Indiaâ€™s Gir Forest.</p>

            <h3>King of the Jungle</h3>
            <p>Lions, often called the "king of the jungle," symbolize strength and leadership. Though they live in
                savannas, not jungles, their commanding presence, majestic mane, and role as top predators earn them
                this royal title across cultures and legends.</p>

            <h3>Sworn Enemy</h3>
            <p>Lions' sworn enemies are often hyenas, with whom they compete fiercely for food and territory. These
                rivals engage in deadly clashes, driven by their overlapping diets and group dynamics, making them
                natural adversaries in the wild.</p>
